# ERD tools

ERD tools is a powerful application developed as part of my thesis project. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating (Enhanced) Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), checking them for errors, and generating relational schemas or SQL code that creates the corresponding relational model.


## Features

- **ER Diagram Creation**: ERD tools allows you to easily create EER diagrams by dragging and dropping entities, attributes, relationships etc onto the canvas. The intuitive interface enables users to build complex diagrams effortlessly.

- **Error Checking**: The application includes an intelligent error-checking feature that analyzes the diagram for common mistakes and inconsistencies. It provides real-time feedback and suggestions to help you create accurate and valid ER diagrams.

- **Relational Schema Generation**: With ERD tools, you can automatically generate the relational schema based on the entities, attributes, and relationships defined in your (Enhanced) ER diagram. This feature saves time and ensures consistency between the diagram and the corresponding schema.

- **SQL Code Generation**: In addition to the relational schema, ERD tools can generate SQL code that creates the entire relational model in a database management system of your choice. This eliminates the need for manual coding and simplifies the process of translating the diagram into a working database.

- **Export and Import**: The application supports exporting your ER diagrams in various formats, such as PNG, SVG or PDF, allowing you to share them with others or include them in your project documentation. It also enables you to import existing .erdt diagrams for further editing or modification.


## Installation

To install ERD tools, follow these steps:

1. Download the jar file of the latest version of ERD tools from (https://github.com/nikoletaln/thesis2) ----> fixy

2. Run the jar file and ERD tools will launch.



## Getting Started

To start using ERD tools, follow these steps:

1. Launch the application by double-clicking the ERD tools icon.

2. Create a new project or open an existing one using the "New Project" or "Open Project" options in the File menu.

3. Use the intuitive interface to design your EER diagram. Drag and drop entities, attributes, and relationships from the toolbar onto the canvas. Connect them to define the relationships between entities.

4. Take advantage of the error-checking feature to ensure the accuracy of your diagram. The application will highlight any potential issues and provide suggestions for improvement.

5. Once your EER diagram is complete and error-free, you can generate the relational schema by selecting the appropriate option from the "Convert to Relational schema" menu.

6. If you need to create the corresponding SQL code, choose the "Convert to SQL" option from the "Generate" menu. Select your preferred database management system and customize any additional settings as needed.

7. Save your project and export the EER diagram in your desired format using the options available in the File menu.
